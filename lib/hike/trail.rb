    # Aliases allow you to drop extra extensions while still declaring the
    # intent of the file. For example, SASS files need the `scss` or `sass`
    # extension to show that they are SASS files, but they're always `css` files
    # and the aliases allow you to not need the `css` extension.
    #
    # For example, if the above example were executed, then when trying to find
    # `application.css`, the trails would understand that `application.scss`
    # is a candidate for being returned.
